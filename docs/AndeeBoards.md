# Andee U/iOS/Android

This section documents the Andee U, Andee iOS and Andee Android shields. All of these shields have the same documentation. Before you start coding, we recommend that you read through the ["Before You Code"](/AnnikkenAndee/BeforeYouCode.md)
section to know the code needed to initialise the Andee Library.
